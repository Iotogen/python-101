# Variables store data.
# A variable can only hold one type of data at a time.
# There are four basic data types in Python:
# Integer for whole numbers, like 4 or 6.
# String for text. (Note: Everything can be a string. Strings are always in quotation marks!)
# Floating Point for decimal numbers, like 4.5 or 2.0
# Boolean for True or False.

# Declaring variables:
# To declare a variable, you need to set its name and value.
# (Note: Variable Names cannot include spaces. Name and value are separated by the equals ('=') character.

# Examples:

 a = 5
 b = "Hello"
 
 myFloat = 2.0
 
 # Python will set the variable type automatically.
 # If - for whatever reason - you would want to change a type, you can just write:
 str(a)
 or float(a)
 
 # Note: When changing variables, note, that not every time can be converted into each other.
 # For example: It is not possible to change a text to an integer.
