# Hello World is the simplest program you can write in a programming language.
# In Python, it looks like this:
print("Hello World!")

# How it works:
# With the "print" statement, we can write a line to a console.
# In the parentheses after the statement, we say what we want to be printed. In our case, it's the sentence "Hello World!".
# We need to put quotation marks around our words, so Python knows, that this is a text.
